# Flappy-Bird-
Flappy Bird Recreated in PyGame using Python. 


This project is a simple recreation of the classic Flappy Bird game using Python and Pygame. The goal is to navigate the bird through gaps in the pipes, avoiding collisions and scoring as many points as possible. It's a great starting point for anyone interested in learning the basics of game development with Pygame.

Features include smooth controls, score tracking, and a retro-inspired design
